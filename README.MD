## This is a Practice application
I am taking this oppertunity to make something in C# as apposed to my normal comfort zone of javascript.
Personally i do enjoy both languages so far but i feel like i know what i want to do with the application, but i don't have the technical basis to easily impliment the solutions in C#
Thus I will be using this to build on my skills and learn alongside my JS endevours.
